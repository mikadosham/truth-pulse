TruthPulse is an AI-powered fact-checking app. Users input a statement, and the app returns a verdict (true, false, or neither), along with an explanation and sources. Built with Next.js, it leverages OpenAI for the fact-checking process and features a retro user interface with validation checks to ensure meaningful input.
